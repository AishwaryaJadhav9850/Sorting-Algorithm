## Bubble Sort - Python Implementation 
[Bubble Sort](https://github.com/AishwaryaJadhav9850/Sorting-Algorithm/commit/7022f523821090581b83a0e6cc6340a63273bcb0)

- Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of О(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted.

- Bubble sort is a Stable sorting algorithm

- Bubble sort is an In-Place sorting algorithm. No additional storage is required

- Bubble sort works nicely for small set of data

## Merge Sort - Python Implementation 
[Merge Sort](https://github.com/AishwaryaJadhav9850/Sorting-Algorithm/commit/404026722c847fdf0b567d495020ceddb5caa32b)

- Merge sort has a worst-case and average complexity of О(nLogn), where n is the number of items being sorted.

- Merge Sort is based on recursion

- Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm

- Merge sort is a Stable sorting algorithm

- Merge sort is not an In-Place sorting algorithm. Additional storage is required for sorting and merging

## Insertion Sort - Python Implementation 
[Insertion Sort](https://github.com/AishwaryaJadhav9850/Sorting-Algorithm/commit/1ef90203b9bb3d525fa2392346d671b58103f021)

- Insertion sort has a worst-case and average complexity of О(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted and Best Case is O(n)

- Insertion sort is a Stable sorting algorithm

- Insertion sort is an In-Place sorting algorithm. No additional storage is required

- Insertion sort works nicely for small set of data

- Insertion sort is an adaptive sorting algorithm as it executes faster when the input is partially sorted.
